    1. Display a menu to the user matching the format in Figure 4.1.
    Special note. Use the ValidatorIO static methods to validate the users input.

    2. If the user selects menu item one, display all the transactions in the expenses.txt file.
    Special note. Invoke the findAll method from the TransactionIO class and format the
    amount data field using $%,6.2.f

    3. If the user selects menu item two, allow the user to add a new transaction to the
    expenses.txt file.
    Special note. Use the ValidatorIO static methods for the user prompts. Allow the user to
    enter as many transactions as they wish by asking them to “Add another transaction.”
    This means you will need at least two while loops. One to check if they want to stay in
    the main program and one to check if they want to stay in the “Add Transactions” section.

    4. If the user selects menu item three, display the total expenses of all transactions in the
    expenses.txt file.
    Special note. Invoke the findAll method from the TransactionIO class and iterate over
    the list to get a running total of the transaction amounts.

    5. Allow the user to stay in the menu by prompting them to continue. If the user does not
    wish to continue, exit the program.
